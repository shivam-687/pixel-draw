# PixelDraw

This project is a fun project for angular beginners.

You can see PixelDrawProject [here](https://pixeldrawproject.netlify.app/).

## Features

1. **ObjectMode:** This mode is on by default. The cursor will do nothing as long as this mode is on. What I mean is that when you do not want to draw, you can keep this mode on. There is also a shortcut to turn it on `ctrl + o`.
2. **DrawMode:** You can do drawing by turning on this mode. You can activate this mode with the button or with the shortcut `ctrl+d`.
3. **EraseMode:** You can erase your drawing with the help of this mode. Its shortcut is `ctrl + e` .
4. **ClearAllMode:** By clicking on this mode, all the drawings will be erased. shortcut is `ctrl+r`.

## Who is this for

First of all, this is a fun project, so if seen, it is for all developers. Any developer can add more features to it and make it more useful. But as I said this is a fun project which is built on Angular framework so any beginner can see and learn it and can add more features to it with their creativity.
